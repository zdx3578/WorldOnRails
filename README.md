## Updates
* We have released the pre-computed Q values in our dataset! Check [DATASET.md](docs/DATASET.md) for details.
* Checkout our [website](https://dotchen.github.io/world_on_rails/) for demo videos!

## Getting Started
* https://github.com/dotchen/WorldOnRails/blob/release/docs/FAQ.md
* To run CARLA and train the models, make sure you are using a machine with **at least** a mid-end GPU.
* Please follow [INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md) to setup the environment.

## Training

* Please refer to [RAILS.md](docs/RAILS.md) on how to train our _World-on-Rails_ agent.
* Please refer to [LBC.md](docs/LBC.md) on how to train the _LBC_ agent.

## Evaluation

**If you evaluating the pretrained weights, make sure you are launching CARLA with `-vulkan`!**

### Leaderboard routes
```bash
python evaluate.py --agent-config=[PATH TO CONFIG]
```

### NoCrash routes
```bash
python evaluate_nocrash.py --town={Town01,Town02} --weather={train, test} --agent-config=[PATH TO CONFIG] --resume
```
* Use defaults for _RAILS_, and `--agent=autoagents/lbc_agent` for _LBC_.
* To print a readable table, use 
```bash
python -m scripts.view_nocrash_results [PATH TO CONFIG.YAML]
```

### Pretrained weights
* [Leaderboard models](https://utexas.box.com/s/8lcl7istkr23dtjqqiyu0v8is7ha5u2r)
* [NoCrash models](https://utexas.box.com/s/54m24gz5xwy1oagsqmgosch7pq561h2e)
